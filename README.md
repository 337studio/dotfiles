# Dotfiles

This is my public repository of dotfiles. Since I'm most definitely not a shell scripting guru, this is always a work-in-process. Much of its contents are borrowed from people much smarter than I am and who were nice enough to share their dotfiles on GitHub.

My starting point for these dotfiles began with [this article](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/), which is a great starting guide if you are trying to sync your dotfiles across computers using GitHub.

This README is pretty bare at the moment, but more to come soon ... Happy configuring.
