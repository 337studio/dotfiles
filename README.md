# Dotfiles

This is my public repository of dotfiles. Since I'm most definitely not a shell scripting guru, these dotfiles will always be a work-in-process and a learning experience.

As I've read elsewhere, people spend years tweaking and customizing their dotfiles to perfection. Luckily, many of these really smart folks are nice enough to share and document their dotfiles with the world. As such, much of the contents in my dotfiles are borrowed/inspired/copied from others.

It can be pretty daunting understanding all the possible configurations of your environment and tools. I have certainly felt overwhelmed and lost many, many times. But it's also been a great learning experience. Just keep at it!

My starting point for these dotfiles began with [this article](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/), which is a great starting guide if you are trying to sync your dotfiles across computers using GitHub.
Some people have really complex and robust install scripts that might be difficult to comprehend if you're just beginning. This article is great because it's easy to follow.

This README is pretty bare at the moment, but more to come soon ... Happy configuring.
